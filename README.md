- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bottyBotz, more formally known as Daniel Efting, a current Masters student in Data Science and Machine Learning at UCL.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ML Applications in industry. Specifically Deep Learning using language, images, or a combination of both are my favorite fields. Consulting for ML solutions tailored to a company's business problem also excites me.
- Deep Learning Frameworks applied to Medical Imaging are of specific interest to me and are the focus of my Master Thesis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about image registration and conditional segmentation.
