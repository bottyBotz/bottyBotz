- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bottyBotz, a recent Masters graduate from UCL in Data Science and Machine Learning.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ML applications in industry as well as the further research in state-of-the-art methods to advance these applications. Specifically Deep Learning using language, images, health science data, or a combination of all. 

- Deep Learning Frameworks applied to Medical Imaging or Health Science data and Automatic Insights from text are of specific interest to me.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about ML's applications to Bioinformatics.
