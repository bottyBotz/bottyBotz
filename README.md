- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dan Efting, an AI Specialist and UCL MSc Graduate in Data Science and Machine Learning.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ML applications in industry as well as the further research in state-of-the-art methods to advance these applications. Especially Deep Learning using language, images, health science data including Electronic Health Record data, or a combination of all. 

- Deep Learning Frameworks applied to Medical Imaging or Health Science data and automatic insights from text are of specific interest to me.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about ML's applications to Bioinformatics.
