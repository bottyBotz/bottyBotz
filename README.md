- 👋 Hi, I’m @bottyBotz, a recent Masters graduate from UCL in Data Science and Machine Learning.

- 👀 I’m interested in ML applications in industry as well as the further research in state-of-the-art methods to advance these applications. Specifically Deep Learning using language, images, or a combination of both are my favorite fields. Consulting for ML solutions tailored to a company's business problem also excites me.

- Deep Learning Frameworks applied to Medical Imaging and Automatic Insights from text are of specific interest to me.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about stable diffusion for text to images.
